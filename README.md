This car park has 10 spaces available so only 10 cars can be parked at the same time. Customers should be able to park a car for a given period (for example 10 days).

###### Task 

Create a simple API, that allows you to make a booking for given dates, manage capacity (number of free spaces), and option to check if there's a car parking space available. 
- Customer should be able to check if there's an available car parking space for given dates 
- Customer should be able to check parking price for given dates (for example summer prices might be different from winter prices) 
- Customers should be able to create a booking for given dates (from - to) 
- Customer should be able to cancel given booking 
- Customer should be able to amend given booking 

**Things to consider**

- Number of available spaces 

API should show how many spaces for given date is available (per day) 
- Parking date From - date when car is being dropped off at the car park 
- Parking date To - date time when car will be picked from the car park 

Example Actions
